    "As soon as we have *data types*, we need *variables* to store the data. In reality, Python does not offer the concept of a variable, but rather that of an *object reference*. As long as the object is immutable (like integers, floats, etc.), there is no significant difference. In this notebook, we discuss the main points surrounding the use of variables in Python."

    "In Python, a variable is a fundamental programming construct that facilitates the storage and management of information in the computer's memory. It is assigned a symbolic name, which serves as a reference to the data stored at a particular location in memory. This symbolic name enables you to access and modify the stored information throughout your code with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are defined using the assignment operator =. You can assign a value to a variable directly or assign the value from another variable, making Python flexible in how it handles data. Rather than containing the data themselves, variables in Python act as references to objects in memory. This reference-based approach allows for efficient memory management and provides the flexibility to interact with and modify the data dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dynamic typing system means that variables can be reassigned to different types of data during program execution. This dynamic nature, combined with the reference model, enhances the language's capability to handle various data types and operations seamlessly. Additionally, Python's garbage collection system manages memory allocation and deallocation, further optimizing performance and resource utilization."

    "## 1. Define variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are four fundamental ways to define a variable, each suited to different purposes and contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Assignment**: This is the most straightforward method where a variable is assigned a specific value directly. This method is used for initializing variables with known values that will be used later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Assignment**: This technique allows you to assign the same value to multiple variables simultaneously. It is useful for initializing several variables with the same value efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallel Assignment**: This method involves defining multiple variables in a single statement with different values. It is effective for initializing several variables at once with distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assignment from Expressions**: Variables can be defined based on expressions involving other variables. This method allows you to create variables that represent calculations or transformations of existing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods provides flexibility in how you manage and utilize variables in your code, catering to different scenarios and requirements.\n"

    "In Python, the type of a variable refers to the kind of data it holds, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or more complex data structures. Python dynamically assigns the type based on the value assigned to the variable. This type can be determined at any point in the code using the `type()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of a variable corresponds to its nature. There are many types of variables (integer, real number, strings, etc.). The most commonly encountered types of variables are integers (`int`), real numbers (`float`), and strings (`str`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic types include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **None** (nothing)\n",
    "- **String types:** `str`\n",
    "   - Enclosed in (single, double, or triple) quotes `'` or `\"`: `'Calvin'`, `\"Calvin'n'Hobbes\"`, `'''Two\\nlines'''`, `\"\"\"'Why?' he asked.\"\"\"`\n",
    "   - Conversion: `str(3.2)`\n",
    "- **Numeric types:**\n",
    "   - **Booleans** `bool` (true/false): `True`, `False`\n",
    "   - **Integers** `int` (no explicit limit value, corresponds to at least C's long type): `-2`, `int(2.1)`, `int(\"4\")`\n",
    "   - **Reals** `float`\n",
    "   - **Complex** `complex`: `1+2j`, `5.1j`, `complex(-3.14)`, `complex('j')`\n",
    "- **Iterable objects:**\n",
    "   - **Lists** `list`: `['a', 3, [1, 2], 'a']`\n",
    "   - **Immutable lists** `tuple`: `(2, 3.1, 'a', [])` (depending on the usage, parentheses are not always required)\n",
    "   - **Keyed lists** `dict`: `{'a':1, 'b':[1, 2], 3:'c'}`\n",

    "### 2.4. Dynamic Typing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. Instead, the type is inferred based on the value assigned to the variable. This allows for more flexibility but also requires careful handling to avoid type-related errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics of Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Type Declaration**: You simply assign a value to a variable, and Python automatically knows what type it is.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 10        # x is an integer\n",
    "    x = \"hello\"   # Now, x is a string\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Type Flexibility**: The type of a variable can change over its lifetime. You can reassign a variable to a value of a different type without any issues.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    y = 3.14      # y is initially a float\n",
    "    y = True      # Now, y is a boolean\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Python handles memory management automatically. When you reassign a variable to a new value, the previous value is discarded if it’s no longer referenced elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and Cons of Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros**:\n",
    "  - **Flexibility**: You can write more general-purpose code since the type is not fixed.\n",
    "  - **Ease of Use**: Less boilerplate code, as there is no need for explicit type declarations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Cons**:\n",
    "  - **Type-Related Errors**: Since types are determined at runtime, it’s possible to encounter errors if the wrong type is used in an operation.\n",
    "  - **Performance**: Dynamic typing can be slower than static typing because type checks are done at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initially, 'data' is an integer\n",
    "data = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, 'data' is a string\n",
    "data = \"Dynamic Typing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# And now 'data' is a list\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python handles these changes without any issues\n",
    "```"

    "The `dir()` function is useful for exploring these methods and understanding what operations are available for a given variable. By calling `dir()` on a variable, you get a list of all its attributes and methods, including those inherited from its type. This can be particularly helpful for discovering how to use a variable's methods or for debugging.\n",

    "print(dir(numbers))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above, `dir(text)` will list methods related to string operations such as `upper()`, `lower()`, and `split()`, while `dir(numbers)` will show methods related to list operations like `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`. This feature of Python makes it easier to explore and utilize the functionalities associated with different data types."
